//SPOILER ALERT.
//
//This file defines every single NPC in Peacenet's single-player campaign. This includes every piece of loot, every story trigger, every set of credentials, everything the game needs to know to have a story.
//Long story short (heh): DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU'RE NOT A DEV. YOU'LL RUIN THE FUN OF THE GAME.
//
//If you are a dev: 
// - Passwords are in plaintext. Use LastPass's "Generate Secure Password" tool (or a similar tool) to generate passwords that are hard for players to crack. Keep their lengths and complexity in line with the NPC's skill level.
// - An NPC that doesn't have a password is not a hackable.
// - Reputation is also important, it dictates how the game handles Government Alert during a hack.
// - If you don't want the Alert system activated for an NPC, set "GovernmentAlert" to false. Default is true.
// - Loot lists are based off loot IDs found in the "LootTable" resource.
// - NPCs whose "Dependencies" have not been hacked do not show in World Map and cannot be connected to.
// - Dependencies are based on an NPC's hostname.
// - Never use an IP address as an NPC hostname. IP addresses are procedurally generated.
// - Country value dictates which part of the storyline this NPC is available in.
// - Elytrose is the player's starting country.
